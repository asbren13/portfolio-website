<div class="container" id="about-container"> <h3>Get to know me:</h3> <p>I recently graduated from St. Lawrence University in 2013. After graduating, I spent some time in the non-profit industry working as a teacher at a residential school for children with autism before working as an Office & Database Manager for a small nonprofit organization that focuses on Down Syndrome cognition research. I transitioned into the web development field in January and spent three months as a student in the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. The rest is history...</p> <p> My hobbies include hiking, rock climbing, skiing, reading, and cooking. You can usually find me curled up in an armchair reading at the Boston Public Library or bouldering at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville, MA.</p> <br> <h3>Connect with me:</h3> <a href="http://github.com/asbren13"><img class="connect-icons" src="/images/github.f1b6b9c2.svg"></a> <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/ashlinnbrennan"><img class="connect-icon" src="/images/linkedin.13d46993.png"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/abrennan90"><img class="connect-icons" src="/images/instagram.56c28d11.jpg"></a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ashlinnbrennan"><img class="connect-icons" src="/images/twitter.d9d08211.png"></a> </div>
